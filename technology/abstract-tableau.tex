\section{tableau}
Tableau is the data visualization software that helps people to see and understand the data. Tableau can connect to almost any database, drag and drop to create visualizations, and share with a click. We can either schedule to get data refreshed or have real time updates with live connection.  We can explore data from any sources from spreadsheets to databases to Hadoop to cloud services in minutes and  dashboard can be published live on the web and on mobile devices~\cite{tableau}.
